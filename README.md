# Database-App
A custom web database app designed to work with sample database information.

This was created as a proof of concept to design and implement a web-based database application. The php files are used to interface
with a MySQL database. This app could use improved UX by using JavaScript, which I learned after building this app. Might add it one day, but right now I'm focusing on Data Science using Python.
